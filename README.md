Brain tumor is a serious disease that can lead
to fatal consequences. Moreover, there are different types of
brain tumor with different progression rate and severeness.
Thus, brain tumor classification is an essential task in medical
diagnosis. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based deep
learning methods shown great potential brain tumor classification
using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans of brain. Recent
development in transformer based deep learning models have
shown promising outcome in image classification task. However,
these models have not yet much explored in the application
of brain tumor classification. In this paper, we employ seven
advanced models which utilizes transformers or mimics the selfattention operation of transformers through their design, for
brain tumor classification. To assess their performance for this
particular task, five conventional CNN based methods have also
been applied and compared with these models. To make our
assessment more coherent and comprehensive we perform the
comparison for four different datasets. The results indicate that
transformer-based advanced models do not provide a distinct
advantage over conventional CNN-based models. The CNN-based
ResNet-50 performs well overall, especially with smaller datasets.
For larger datasets, transformer-based models generally perform
better than CNN-based models, although the difference is not
significant.
